            Hi! <br> We are Martina and Martin- couple, who’s paths were crossed from the first moment we’ve met. As it
            usually goes with graduated managers, we joined in one of the multinational corporations. And even on the
            same day. It didn’t take long, and colleagues became friends and friends became a couple.
        </p>
        <p class="dAbsolute storyText storyText2">
            In the environment where we worked an individual with our point of view soon begins to think whether his
            work
            makes sense at all. We increasingly started to perceive contradiction with our conviction and that it needs
            to be changed.

        <p class="dAbsolute storyText storyText3">Compliance with our values is essential for us to be happy. We wrote
            everything down and decided what we

                    steps forward and we were a
                    little better than yesterday. We have certainly still something to learn but we believe that if a
                    person does work with the heart, it is also visible in the results. We do not want to distinguish
                    whether we are happy in private or at work. <span class="bold">We want to be happy all the

                    sustainability to be a necessity. However, despite the growing promotion of the need to reflect on
                    the future of our planet, we still observe that there is still huge room for improvement, especially
                    in people’s daily lives. Through our activities, we want to contribute to <span class="bold">reduce
                        the ecological footprint</span> not only of us as a company, but also give such an opportunity
                    to the people who will visit it.

                    are greatly influenced by the people around us. We understood that <span class="bold">interpersonal relationships</span>  are

            The fact how much people impact conditions of living on Earth by their actions is familiar to many of us.
            Most of times it seems that trying to live sustainably requires a lot of adaptation. We’re overthinking this
            problem, complicating our lives and sometimes even making sacrifices to help our planet at least a little.
            In our effort to find compromise between what is good for us and for the nature we’re daily facing obstacles
            in the form of consumption. </p>
        <p class="bold hPadding missionText">
            However, we honestly want to make the world a little bit better place for living.

        <p class="hPadding missionText missionMarBot"> Our mission is taking part in decreasing waste production in one
            of the first steps – while shopping. We
            would like to show you one of the possibilities of how to decrease your ecological footprint without making
            you feel that living “eco “ is expensive and complicated. We’re offering an alternative to the consuming way
            of living and we will be pleased to show you, that living sustainably can be easy and pleasant. We want to
            help people to live in a good relationship with nature while helping themselves too.
